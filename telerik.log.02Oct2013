[12:03:08] <dencho> Един султан имал 10 ковчежника, които съхранявали неговото богатство под формата на златни монети, всяка от които тежала точно 10 грама. Но той подозирал, че един от ковчежниците му го крадял като преправял монетите
[12:03:08] <dencho> на 9г. Въпросът е как с едно претегляне на везната, да се установи , кой от всичките ковчежници е мошеника , като за целта имаме следните условия:
[12:03:08] <dencho> -можем да вземем произволно число монети от всекиго
[12:03:08] <dencho> -везната е съвсем обикновенна, но може да претегли безкрайно много монети

[14:35:13] <KpeTeHoug> Normal system administration practices such as ensuring that files (configuration and zone files) are securely backed-up, proper read and write permissions applied and sensible physical access control to servers may be sufficient.

[14:37:34] <KpeTeHoug> що бинд в чруут
[14:37:40] <phalaaxx> ааа
[14:37:44] <phalaaxx> ми щото може :D
[14:38:24] <yulimoto> има някаква тенденция от секюрити гледна точка да се пуска в chroot
[14:38:33] <yulimoto> може би не е само за bind
[14:38:39] <phalaaxx> да
[14:38:39] <phalaaxx> по-сигурно е, ако някой го счупи нещо и върви като root - може да успее да изпълни код като root
[14:38:44] <yulimoto> та си мисля, че може би си по-запознат
[14:38:56] <phalaaxx> по тази причина или chroot или setuid/setgid
[14:39:06] <yulimoto> добре ама то не върви като рут
[14:39:37] <yulimoto> то си върви със системен юзер
[14:40:21] <phalaaxx> няма значение
[14:40:21] <phalaaxx> аз примерно правих една тъпотия дето идеята и е уеб приложения да вървят в chroot, независимо че не им се дава root
[14:40:26] <phalaaxx> това дава по-голяма сигурност
[14:40:46] <phalaaxx> по принцип chroot по дизайн не е измислен с цел сигурност
[14:41:09] <phalaaxx> и ако си root в chroot - има много по-голям шанс да излезеш извън chroot-а отколкото ако не си root

[15:04:36] <KrasiGa> е как успях да си счупя крачето на клавиатурата :(
[15:04:53] <KrasiGa> видяхте ли техниката за умножение? много е яка
[15:05:10] <phalaaxx> lxc-create ми дърпа със debootstrap разни работи
[15:05:24] <phalaaxx> и задава разни въпроси в curses прозорци
[15:06:32] <phalaaxx> което означава 2 неща: 1. за всеки потребител ми трябва отделен bootstrap (съответно много повече дисково пространство) и 2. много по-трудно мога да автоматизирам процеса по създаване на потребител
[15:06:49] <phalaaxx> ndyakov: поправи ме ако греша, не съм го цъкал още достатъчно :D
[15:07:32] <yulimoto> KrasiGa: къде е тази техника ?
[15:07:43] <ndyakov> момент, че ме нямаше, ей сега ще видя

[15:08:09] <ndyakov> phalaaxx: веднъж като дръпне bootstrapa, няма да го тегли повече
[15:08:35] <ndyakov> не знам дали ако си създадеш втори, дали просто ще направи линкове към файловете или ще ги копира - това трябва да се тества.
[15:08:49] <ndyakov> автоматизирането не виждам как
[15:08:51] <ndyakov> ще е трудно
[15:12:53] <KpeTeHoug> това старо с умножаването
[15:13:02] <KpeTeHoug> проблемът е че ние сме научени на друга система
[15:13:10] <KpeTeHoug> и трудно ще ни отучат
[15:13:16] <KrasiGa> старо ама аз не го знаех
[15:13:30] <KrasiGa> тествах го и ми се стори готино
[15:13:33] <phalaaxx> chroot мога да си го автоматизирам така че потребителя като си направи поръчка през контролен панел и приложението го препрати да си плати някъде онлайн, след като си плати да му се създаде акаунт (в chroot) и да започне веднага да си го ползва
[15:13:50] <phalaaxx> така де акаунта не се създава в chroot средата, грешно се изразих
[15:14:25] <phalaaxx> акаунта си е на машината но всичко което потребителя може да прави на тази машина се изпълнява в chroot само за него
[15:16:01] <yulimoto> говориш за акаунт на линукса ли ?
[15:16:07] <yulimoto> мда сори
[15:16:26] <yulimoto> да това е интересно
[15:16:28] <phalaaxx> впрочем втория контейнер ми го направи за 56 секунди - което води до още един голям проблем
[15:16:30] <yulimoto> доста интересно
[15:16:54] <phalaaxx> ако прехвърлям акаунти от една машина на друга - за 500 акаунта ще трябва да чакам 500 минути само за да им създам контейнерите
[15:18:05] <phalaaxx> ако това го правя защото примерно ми е изгърмяло захранването на основния сървър и местя разни работи към някой свободен такъв - за 500 минути ще ми се стопи телефона да давям обяснение защо не работят разни сайтове и пощи :)

[15:26:49] <yulimoto> трябва да ги разгледам, щото си мисля как ще направя една система с телескоп и позиционер, който може да се контролира от щатите примерно, та там съм си мислел точно за такива акаунти

[15:50:39] <ndyakov> phalaaxx: при мен втория го направи за ~5 секунди
[15:51:16] <ndyakov> пак може да се автоматизира, може да се направят различни рестрикции на това какви ресурси да ползват
[15:51:35] <ndyakov> и можеш всичките да ги изсипеш в един контейнер, а вътре каквот искаш да си оправляваш security-то
