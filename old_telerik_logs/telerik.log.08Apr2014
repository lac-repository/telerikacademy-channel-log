[12:26:23] -kloeri_ (~kloeri@freenode/staff/exherbo.kloeri) to $$*- [Global Notice] Hi all. In the next few minutes we're going to restart a bunch of servers due to an openssl security vulnerability (CVE-2014-0160). This is unfortunately going to be very noisy but should be over with relatively quickly. Thanks for using freenode and have a good day.
